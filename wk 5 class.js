/*Coding Steps:
•	Create a menu app as seen in this week’s video. What you create is up to you as long as it meets the following requirements:
•	Use at least one array.
•	Use at least two classes.
•	Your menu should have the options to create, view, and delete elements.*/







/*one array*/

//a car//

//book-shelf-library//
//song-album-
/*two classes*/


//single entity//
//function = method is a function, when it's a part of a class//

    constructor(title, author) { //temp name placeholders//
        this.title = t;
        this.author = a;

    }
    describe() {
        console.log(`${title} by ${author}`);
